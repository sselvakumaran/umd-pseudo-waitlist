# umd-pseudo-waitlist
Webscraper made to act as a waitlist for courses that don't have waitlists at the University of Maryland.
## Why?
For some reason, the University of Maryland has some courses that do not have waitlists. I made a program that will run in the background of your computer to continually scan for when a seat opens using BeautifulSoup webscraping.
It has a terminal window to show output in case of any errors.
